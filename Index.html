            <h3>The black and white "tuxedo" look penguins have is a form of camouflage called countershading</h3>
            <p>Penguins use a special kind of camouflage called countershading. 
                Their black backs help them blend in with the dark ocean when predators look down from above, 
                while their white bellies match the bright surface when seen from below. 
                This sneaky adaptation helps them avoid being seen by both predators and prey 
                while swimmingâ€”like wearing a built-in disguise!</p>
